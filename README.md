## Description

* WebSafe is a children's game that helps the users of any age know about the different types of Cyber Threats in a light and fun environment.
* The game could be played by every budding teenager who wants to secure himself/herself before stepping into the world of the internet.

--------------------------------------

### Game Modes
* The game begins with the user getting introduced to our gameplay and what exactly is the purpose of the game.
* It moves on to the single-player mode where the player encounters various types of cyberattacks and depending on it's responses to those he/she acquires points.
* Once the player acquires enough points which prove the understanding he/she has regarding the attacks, it will move on to the multiplayer mode(In designing phase). 

#### Future add-ons

- [ ] The multiplayer mode.
- [ ] Incorporating different cyber attacks for teaching purposes.

----------------------------------------

## Problem tackled
- Fishing, fake messages, unwanted permissions, surveillance, etc are the various cyber-attacks that one sees on a daily basis.
- With the younger generations moving faster and getting exposed to the various cyber-attacks before they can comprehend leads to a lot of them getting trapped.
- Our game ensures their understanding and knowledge about various attacks and allows to them make wiser choices while surfing the web.
- Most apps, chrome extensions, etc, help avoid cyberbullying at the point of the attack but our game ensures their understanding and prepares them for these attacks prior to their occurrence.
